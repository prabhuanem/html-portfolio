    <p>Hey! I’m Mani Ratna Sai Prabhu Teja Anem, but most people just call me Prabhu 😊. I’m a laid-back, curious, and social soul who loves finding joy in the little things.</p>

    <p>Here’s a glimpse of what makes me, me:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>🏏 Cricket Enthusiast – Whether it's playing with friends or watching a nail-biting match, cricket is my forever favorite.</li>
        <li>🎬 Movie Buff – From feel-good dramas to edge-of-the-seat thrillers, I enjoy all kinds of films (and always up for movie night suggestions!).</li>
        <li>🧑‍🤝‍🧑 Hanging Out with Friends – Good vibes, great conversations, and a lot of laughter — nothing beats a chill evening with friends.</li>
        <li>✈️ Occasional Explorer – I enjoy traveling now and then, discovering new places, foods, and stories along the way.</li>
    </ul>

    I’m all about good energy, meaningful moments, and staying grounded — whether I'm at home, out with friends, or planning my next little adventure. Thanks for stopping by! 👋
